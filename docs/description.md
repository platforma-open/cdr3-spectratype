# Overview

Calculates spectratype: a histogram of read counts by CDR3 nucleotide or amino acid length for the present variable segment families. The spectratype is useful to detect pathological and highly clonal repertoires, as the spectratype of non-expanded T- and B-cells has a symmetric gaussian-like distribution.
